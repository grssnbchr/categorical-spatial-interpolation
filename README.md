This is the code and data for [the blog post and tutorial on how to spatially interpolate such a map with R's `ggplot2` and `kknn` packages and some parallel processing](https://timogrossenbacher.ch/2018/03/categorical-spatial-interpolation-with-r). Instructions on how to use this can be found there.
